			<h2>Why give blood</h2><br>
			Giving blood saves lives. The blood you give is a lifeline in an emergency and for people who need long-term treatments.
			Many people would not be alive today if donors had not generously given their blood.
			<br><br><strong>Why we need you to give blood</strong><br>
			We need over 6,000 blood donations every day to treat patients in need across England. Which is why there’s always a need for people to give blood.
			Each year we need approximately 200,000 new donors, as some donors can no longer give blood.
			Most people between the ages of 17-65 are able to give blood.
			Around half our current donors are over 45. 
			That's why we need more young people (over the age of 17) to start giving blood, so we can make sure we have enough blood in the future.
			<br><br><strong>Blood groups and types needed now</strong><br>
			We need more donors from all blood groups and types. We particularly need more people from Black, 
			Asian and minority ethnic communities to give blood so that we have a supply of certain blood types.
			<br><br><strong>About blood</strong><br>
			Blood has many different parts or components including red blood cells, plasma and platelets.
			It is also classified into different blood groups and blood types. Find out why we need blood and how it is used.
			<br><br>

			<div id="1" style="display:none;">
			<h2>The need for blood</h2><br>
			We need to make sure that we have enough supplies of all blood groups and blood types to treat all types of conditions.
			By giving blood, every donor helps us meet the challenge of providing life-saving products whenever and wherever they are needed.
			<br><br><strong>Maintaining the blood supply</strong><br>
			We need to maintain a regular supply of all blood groups and types so we can provide it to the hospitals and patients who need it.  
			Some rare sub-types are more common in Black communities, which is why we need more blood donors from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. 
			We sometimes need to target specific blood types to increase stock levels. 
			That's why we sometimes contact regular donors with the particular blood type we need, and ask them to give blood.
			We are indebted to our regular blood donors for their role in helping us to save lives.
			<br><br><strong>Rare blood types</strong><br>
			O Rh negative blood is rare but essential because it is the only blood type that can be given to anyone, regardless of their blood type.
			Donors with the blood group B Rh positive are more often found in Black and south Asian minority ethnic communities.
			Similarly, some rare subtypes, such as Ro, are more common in Black communities. More about the need for blood donors from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.
			<br><br><strong>Blood components</strong><br>
			Your blood's main components are red cells, plasma and platelets. These are used to treat many different illnesses and conditions.
			They have a short shelf life, so we always need to top up the supply:
			<ul>
				<li>red blood cells can be stored for up to 35 days
				<li>platelets can be stored for up to 7 days
				<li>plasma can be stored for up to 3 years
			</ul><br>
			</div>
			
			<div id="2" style="display:none;">
			<h2>How blood is used</h2><br>
			Blood or the components of blood are used to treat patients with medical conditions such as anaemia, cancer blood disorders, and those having surgery.
			<br><br><strong>Blood components</strong><br>
			Blood is made up of a number of components, including red blood cells, platelets and plasma. Each of these can be used to treat many different conditions.
			Blood is usually separated into its individual components or parts, so a patient can be given the particular component they need.
			This makes the most of every blood donation, as the components in one unit of blood (or one donation) can be used to treat different patients.
			<br><br><strong>Blood transfusions</strong><br>
			Donated blood or components are given to a patient in a blood transfusion. Blood transfusions are given via an intravenous line into a blood vessel.
			<br><br><strong>How blood was used in 2014, according to hospital usage:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>67% was used to treat medical conditions including anaemia, cancer and blood disorders
				<li>27% was used in surgery, including cardiac surgery and emergency surgery
				<li>6% was used to treat blood loss after childbirth
			</ul>
			Usage varies between hospitals depending on their particular specialties. 
			NHS Blood and Transplant works closely with hospitals to make sure valuable blood donations are used appropriately. 
			The demand for blood from hospitals has fallen due to increased efficiency, but new donors are always needed to make sure there is enough blood to treat those who need it. 
			<br><br><strong>Blood transfusions for people who are dying</strong><br>
			Blood can be vital for people with medical conditions or who are having surgery. But blood transfusions can also improve the quality of life for people whose illness has no cure.
			These vital transfusions give patients a better quality of life and the energy and ability to enjoy this precious, final time with their families.<br><br>

			<h2>Who you could help</h2><br>
			Your blood saves lives. Your blood donation is an amazing gift to people who need it in an emergency or for on-going medical treatment.<br>
			We need over 6,000 people to give blood every day to meet the needs of hospitals and patients
			<br><br><strong>Real life story</strong><br><br>
			<i>Shaylah:</i><br>
			Shaylah has a rare condition and needs regular blood transfusions, even over Christmas, to keep her alive.
			The seven year old needs blood transfusions every 3 weeks to treat the painful inherited blood disorder, sickle cell disease.
			She had a stem cell transplant from her mum in April but complications mean she is unwell again and currently having regular transfusions.
			Shaylah says: “It makes me feel better because sometimes I get really tired and once I get my super girl blood I feel strong like supergirl!
			“Blood donors are my heroes. I would say a big big thank youuuuuu!! 
			Thank you for being so kind and not being scared of needles like me and I would give them a cuddle for being so kind and chocolate because I love chocolate.”
			The disorder, which affects red blood cells, has led to her needing intensive care treatment twice already in her short life, and has caused Moyamoya syndrome, where some arteries that deliver blood to her brain are constricted.
			Her mum Leila said: 'Sickle cell affects Shaylah quite a lot - she gets tired very easily, she will wake up with aches and pains, 
			and she gets ill a lot because her immune system is weak. 
			'To look at her you wouldn't think there was anything wrong but she has been through a lot. When she was on a supported breathing machine in intensive care, that was difficult to 
			see her going through that. It changes your whole life and you just have to get on with things.
			'But she is a little trooper. She is used to the transfusions now and she doesn't cry or anything. She doesn't talk about it and I try and keep it as simple as possible for her. 
			I tell her 'now they are going to take the bad blood out and put the supergirl blood in'.
			'I would like to say thank you to all the donors. It may not seem like a big thing when you donate but it goes to people who really need it’.
			More blood donors from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities are needed to help patients like Shaylah and to meet the needs of hospitals and patients. 
			Certain conditions, such as sickle cell and thalassaemia, are more prevalent within these communities. And, some rare types are also only found within these communities. 
			Patients who require regular blood transfusions benefit from receiving blood from donors with a similar ethnic background.<br><br>
