			<h2>The donation process</h2><br>
			Giving blood is simple and it saves lives. When you give blood, it is collected so it can be used to treat someone else.
			For most people, giving blood is easy and follows the simple steps listed below. See our animation which takes you through what happens step by step.
			<br><br><strong>Before you give blood</strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Check you are able to give blood.
				<li>Find an appointment – a number of appointments can be booked in advance. If you are unable to book now, then please try for a later date. 
					A limited number of walk-in slots are available.
				<li>Register to be a donor online.
				<li>Follow the preparing to give blood recommendations.
			</ul>
			<br><strong>When you give blood</strong><br>
			This is what will happen when you attend your appointment, or go to a drop-in session, to give blood. 
			If you attend an appointment to give blood we aim to ensure it takes no more than an hour.
			<br><br><strong>1. Welcome and preparation</strong><br>
			We will ask you to read our Welcome leaflet which explains the importance of blood safety. 
			It’s important to read this whenever you attend because advice does change. 
			We will give you 500ml of fluid just before you give blood. Drinking this over about 5 minutes will help with your well-being during and after donation.
			<br><br><strong>2. Health screening</strong><br>
			We make sure it is safe for you to donate, and that your blood donation is safe for a patient to receive.
			We confirm your identity and ask you about the information on your donor health check form; a registered nurse may follow up if necessary.
			We test a drop of blood from your finger to check the iron levels (haemoglobin) in your blood.
			If you are not able to donate we will explain why, and may ask you to make another appointment.
			If you are able to donate you will be asked to sit in a waiting area until you are called to a donation chair. 
			<br><br><strong>3. Your blood donation</strong><br>
			When you are comfortable on the chair we will ask you to confirm your name, address and date of birth.
			We examine your arm and place a cuff on your arm to maintain a small amount of pressure during donation (this does not measure blood pressure).
			We then examine your arm to find a suitable vein and clean it with an antiseptic sponge.
			We will insert a needle in your arm which will collect your blood into a blood bag with your unique donor number.
			You should not feel any discomfort or pain. If you do, tell a member of staff.
			A scale weighs the blood and stops when you have donated 470ml (or just under a pint). This usually takes between 5-10 minutes.
			The needle will be removed and a sterile dressing applied to your arm.<br><br><br>
			</div>
			
			<div id="1" style="display:none;">
			<h2>Registering online</h2><br>
			New or existing blood donors can use our online service to book an appointment to give blood in Ireland. 
			New donors must be aged between 17-65.
			<br><br><strong>Create an online account</strong><br><br>
			It’s quick and easy. You can:
			<ul>
				<li>find out where you can donate and book an appointment
				<li>view, change or cancel appointments
				<li>update your personal details
				<li>view your recent donation history within the last 5 years
				<li>You'll need a personal email address that only you can access.
			</ul>
			<br><br><br>
			</div>
			
			<div id="2" style="display:none;">
			<h2>Preparing to give blood</h2><br>
			Follow our tips to make your blood donation experience pleasant, safe and straightforward.
			<br><br><strong>Eat</strong><br><br>
			Eat regular meals to help you avoid feeling lightheaded. Please do not donate if you are in a period of fasting.
			<br><br><strong>Sleep</strong><br>
			A good night's sleep will boost wellbeing.
			<br><br><strong>Drink</strong><br>
			Drink plenty of fluids 24 hours before donating, but avoid alcohol.
			<br><br><strong>Wear</strong><br>
			Put on loose and comfortable clothing, avoid tight sleeves.
			<br><br><strong>Distract</strong><br>
			Nervousness is normal, come with a friend or bring along a book or MP3 player so you can relax during your visit.
			<br><br><strong>Know</strong><br>
			Knowing your medical, body piercing and travel history will save you time.
			<br><br><strong>Exercise</strong><br>
			You can still exercise, but don't do anything more strenuous than usual: this applies before and after donating blood. 
			Also ensure you are fully recovered and well hydrated before you donate blood.<br><br><br>
			</div>
			
			<div id="3" style="display:none;">
			<h2>What happens on the day</h2><br>
			From the moment you arrive at your donation session, we will guide you through the process, explain what we are doing and answer any questions you may have.
			<br><br><strong>Welcome and preparation</strong><br>
			Before donating blood, please eat regular meals, drink plenty of fluid (non-alcoholic) and avoid vigorous exercise or exertion.
			When you attend your donation session please read our Welcome leaflet: this explains the importance of blood safety. 
			It's important to read this every time you attend, because advice does change.
			We must give you sufficient information so that you can make an informed choice, on the benefits and risks of donating blood and samples for testing.
			We will provide 500ml of fluid just before you donate. By drinking this over about 5 minutes, it will help with your wellbeing during and after donation.
			<br><br><strong>Health screening</strong><br>
			You will be called for private health screening, where a donor carer will confirm your identity. 
			It’s critical that we guarantee an accurate link between you, your Donor Health Check and your donation.
			We must ensure that it's safe for you to donate and your donation is safe for a patient to receive. 
			We’ll ask some confidential questions based on your completed Donor Health Check.
			There is a period of time from contact with any infection to detecting markers in the laboratory. 
			We trust your honesty when answering these personal questions. This will ensure your blood is safe to transfuse to patients.
			You may be referred to a registered nurse for certain medical queries: their uniforms have red piping on the collar and cuffs. 
			An explanation will always be provided if you are not able to donate. You will be advised when you can donate, and we’ll encourage you 
			to make an appointment before you leave (the team are only able to book future appointments for the venue they are currently at).
			For your wellbeing, we must ensure you have enough haemoglobin (iron) in your blood before donating. 
			A small blood sample will be taken from your finger to test your haemoglobin levels. If your test is borderline, we will offer you a confirmatory test.
			This requires a sample of blood from your arm, to be tested in a machine at the session. We will advise you of the result.
			Following health screening, you will be asked to sit in a different waiting area. From here you’ll be called and invited to a donation chair.
			<br><br><strong>Your donation</strong><br>
			When you are comfortable on the chair, you will be asked your name, address and date of birth again.
			Blood bags and sample tubes are labelled with unique donor identification numbers. 
			All collection equipment is single use and sterile; only one blood bag is filled with your donation.
			A blood pressure cuff will be placed on your arm to maintain a small amount of pressure during your donation. 
			The cuff is not used to measure blood pressure.
			Your arm will be thoroughly examined to find a suitable vein before being cleaned with an antiseptic sponge. 
			This kills normal bacteria (germs) on the skin. You will see staff cleaning their hands frequently, using hand wipes or gels.
			Donors are advised to do applied muscle tension exercises during donation. 
			This is to maintain blood pressure and promote wellbeing during and after donation.
			Following needle insertion you should be comfortable during your donation. 
			If you experience any discomfort or pain please alert a member of staff.
			An agitator scale constantly weighs and measures your donation. 
			It will stop automatically when your donation is complete. Donor carers will be available to you throughout your donation.
			You may hear beeping noises from the agitator, these inform us of the progress of your donation. 
			A full donation is 470ml and will usually take between 5 and 10 minutes.
			If you require assistance or have any concerns, please make us aware by raising your non-donation arm. 
			After donation, the needle will be removed and a sterile dressing applied to your arm.
			We advise that you leave the pressure roll on for 30 minutes and the plaster dressing on for 6 hours. 
			Please avoid using this arm to push on or to carry anything heavy.
			We will give you a card at the end of your donation with important care advice. 
			Donors are also asked to apply additional pressure to the venepuncture site while waiting for their drink at the refreshment area.
			<br><br><strong>After donation refreshment</strong><br>
			A selection of drinks and snacks are available at the refreshment table. 
			We encourage donors to relax here for at least 15 minutes and to have at least 2 drinks following donation.
			If you feel unwell, please remain seated and alert a member of staff immediately. Where possible, we encourage you to book an appointment for your next donation.
			<br><br><br>

			<div id="4" style="display:none;">
			<h2>After your donation</h2><br>
			During a blood donation we take 470ml of blood, which is just under a pint.
			Your donation is transported to one of our blood centres where it is tested and processed before being issued to hospitals. 
			If you’ve ever wondered what happens to your blood donation view our animation.
			After donation, your body has an amazing capacity to replace the blood you have given.
			To help you stay well after you have given blood, we advise you to:
			<ul>
				<li>keep the pressure bandage on your arm for about 30 minutes after you have given blood, and the plaster on for 6 hours
				<li>rest for a short time after giving blood
				<li>eat and drink – you will be encouraged to have at least 2 drinks and a snack before you leave
				<li>avoid using the donation arm to carry anything very heavy for the rest of the day
				<li>avoid having a hot bath after you have given blood
			</ul>
			If you feel faint (light headed or dizzy, hot, sweating, trembling, shaky or nauseous) lie down immediately, rest until you feel better and drink plenty of fluid.
			If bleeding recurs, sit down, raise your arm and press on the area where the blood is coming from for at least 5 minutes.
