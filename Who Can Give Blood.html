			<h2>Who can give blood</h2><br>
			Most people can give blood. You can give blood if you:
			<ul>
				<li>are fit and healthy
				<li>weigh over 7 stone 12 lbs or 50kg
				<li>are aged between 17 and 66 (or 70 if you have given blood before)
				<li>are over 70 and have given blood in the last two years
			</ul>
			<br><strong>How often can I give blood?</strong><br>
			Men can give blood every 12 weeks and women can give blood every 16 weeks.
			<br><br><strong>Check you are able to give blood</strong><br>
			If you have an existing medical condition or have a question about your eligibility to give blood you should check the health and travel section before you book an appointment.
			<br><br><strong>Common eligibility questions include:</strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>receiving treatment
				<li>taking medication
				<li>travelling outside of the Ireland
				<li>tattoos
				<li>pregnancy
				<li>illness
				<li>cancer
				<li>received blood, blood products or organs
			</ul>
			If you answered yes to any question on your Donor Health Check questionnaire, you should check the A-Z list of health and travel queries to see if you are able to give blood.
			<br><br><strong>Women under 20 - check if you can give blood</strong><br>
			If you are a woman under 20 and you weigh under 10st 3lb or 65kg or are under 5' 6" or 168cm tall you will need to estimate your blood volume to see if you can give blood.
			<br><br>

			<h2>Health Considerations</h2><br>
			<br><strong>A-V Block</strong><br>
			You must not donate if you are experiencing any symptoms associated with your abnormal heartbeat such as dizziness, extreme tiredness, shortness of breath, weakness 
			or if you require medication to control your abnormal heartbeat/rhythm.
			<br><br><br><strong>A-V Tachycardia</strong><br>
			You must not donate if you are experiencing any symptoms associated with your abnormal heartbeat such as dizziness, extreme tiredness, 
			shortness of breath, weakness or if you require medication to control your abnormal heartbeat/rhythm.
			<br><br><br><strong>Abdominoplasty : Surgery</strong><br>
			If you had any infection you cannot give blood until you have been completely recovered for at least 14 days. *
			All wounds are fully healed.
			Sadly, if the surgery was for cancer you cannot give blood.
			If your surgery or procedure was performed through a natural orifice (ie nose,mouth, vagina, anus) you cannot give blood for 4 months from date of procedure.
			You cannot give blood whilst you are awaiting hospital appointments or are still under medical care.
			If you have had or think you had a Blood Transfusion or any Blood Products since 1st January 1980 you cannot give blood. **
			You must have returned to normal activities of daily living (for example routine housework, back to employment, driving etc).
			You must be fully recovered and its been at least 7 days from your surgery if the other criteria does not apply.
			* An unhealed wound or sore is a risk for bacteria entering the blood.  Bacteria in the blood can be a serious threat to anybody receiving blood.
			** Although it cannot be certain that transfusions caused the problems with the recipients of blood developing vCJD it has been thought prudent to
			exclude blood donors transfused or possibly transfused since 1980.  Previously, this was within Ireland but now is anywhere in the world.
			<br><br><br><strong>Abrasion following a punch : Inoculation Injury</strong><br>
			A 'SHARPS' or an 'INOCULATION'  or a 'NEEDLESTICK' INJURY  refers to Piercing the skin with a hypodermic needle that was used on another person 
			to inject medication or take blood (i.e. a Nurse may inject someone and then accidently dig themselves with the needle). 
			It is for much the same reason that we inlcude Human Bites, Abrasion Following a Punch and Blood Splashes with this guideline as it 
			is concerned with the risk of any infection being passed on.
			Because of the possible risk of infection being transferred from one person to another in the blood stream, we require a 4 month deferral to ensure this does not happen.
			There is not always a reason to be concerned that this risk exists, but we are unable to test the other person and be sure there was none. 
			Therefore we cannot take blood to give to a patient safely and confidently.<br><br><br>

			<h2>Travel Considerations</h2><br>
			<br><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br>
			If you visited the areas of Kunduz, Balch, Dschuzdschan, Faryab, Badghis, Herat, Farah, Nimrus, Helmand, Kandahar, Zabul, 
			Ghazni, Paktika, Chost, Paktia, Lugar, Kabul, Laghman between the months of May and November, you need to wait for six months after your return 
			to the Ireland before giving blood. If you returned on a date outside of May to November please calculate 6 months from 30th November, 
			When you go to give blood, after the six months are up, please let the staff know that you have been travelling. 
			They will then ask you some further questions which will act as an extra safety check to ensure that you are OK to give blood on the day.
			<br><br><br><strong>Algeria</strong><br>
			If you visited the desert oasis of Ihrir (Illizi Department) at any time of the year, 
			you need to wait for six months after your return to the Ireland before giving blood. 
			When you go to give blood, after the six months are up, please let the staff know that you have been travelling. 
			They will then ask you some further questions which will act as an extra safety check to ensure that you are OK to give blood on the day.
			<br><br><br><strong>Syria</strong><br>
			You can give blood.<br>
			However, when you go to give blood, please let the staff know that you have recently been out of the country. 
			They will ask you some further questions which will act as an extra safety check to ensure that you are OK to give blood on the day.	
			<br><br><br><strong>USA</strong><br>
			If you have visited USA between 1st May and 30th November -You may attend session as long as you have not been diagnosed with West Nile Virus, 
			if so then you need to wait 6 months from the date of recovery. If you have been unwell whilst abroad or within 4 weeks
			since you returned from the country visited then you need to wait 7 days from completion of antibiotics and 14 days from full recovery before 
			attending session and at least 4 weeks have passed from your return date.  Please mention this to the session staff as we may need to do an extra test.
			<br><br><br>
			</div>
			
			<div id="3" style="display:none;">
			<h2>Donors and disability</h2><br>
			Everyone can volunteer to give blood, whether they have a disability or not. 
			However, we must make sure that it’s safe for people to give blood and for patients to receive donated blood.
			We need to be certain that anyone who wants to give blood understand what’s involved, 
			how they will feel, and the things they’ll need to do afterwards to take care of themselves. If we think that someone doesn’t completely understand, 
			we can’t let them give blood.
			<br><br><br><strong>Bringing a carer</strong><br>
			Carers are welcome: we just ask that they introduce themselves to a member of staff. 
			They can accompany you throughout the donation process, apart from the private screening; this is to maintain confidentiality.
			<br><br><br><strong>Accessibility and wheelchair users</strong><br>
			All of our donor centres are wheelchair-accessible: you can call them before booking for more detailed information about the facilities they offer. 
			Not all of our community-based venues (eg church halls and community centres) will be accessible – if possible, 
			we suggest you contact the venue before booking a donation session.
			If you use a wheelchair and come on your own, you must be able to get from your wheelchair to the donation beds or chairs and back again. 
			Our staff aren’t allowed to help you, due to Health and Safety Guidelines.
			<br><br><br><strong>Hearing impairment</strong><br>
			You may bring a signer or translator. However, if you need a signer or translator (third party interpreter) 
			to be present at any part of the selection procedure where there is an exchange of confidential information (such as during the health screening process), they must:
			<br>a) Understand the requirements of the Blood Safety and Quality Regulations relevant to the donation process.
			<br>b) Not be personally known to the donor.
			Please be aware that NHS Blood and Transplant do not routinely provide a signing or translation service at our blood donation sessions. 
			Although we have some donation staff who are British Sign Language certified and may be able to act as a third party interpreter, we cannot guarantee the availability of 
			this service at all blood donation sessions.
			<br><br><br><strong>Visual Impairment</strong><br>
			We have large print versions of the welcome folder and Donor Health Check Questionnaire. We can also talk you through the questionnaire.
			If you have colour blindness or dyslexia, you can ask for coloured overlays at the welcome desk.<br><br>
